\\[Team story] Kim wants to study effectively using flashcards. He creates a flashcard set through the application and is able to cycle (and flip) through them using the program UI or keyboard inputs 

[Allie’s story] Kevin makes a flashcard set to study for his biology test. He knows he’s unsure of certain topics and confident in other areas. Through the program, he is able to sort cards into a “known” or “not known” category”. After sorting all of his cards in the set, he is able to study solely the “not known” category to better study for his test.
[Maya’s story] Alice is interested in geography and wants to quickly learn the flags of all the countries in the world; she creates a set of flashcards by uploading images of each country’s flag (connected to its country’s name) and tests her knowledge whenever she has free time. This allows her to learn conveniently and efficiently.
[Antony’s story] Jenny has created a flashcard set, but wants to add more cards to it and fix some typos. Through the program, she is able to re-order cards, add/remove cards, and edit cards. Her edits are saved and she can study from the edited set.
[Mason’s story] John has already created a flashcard set, but wants to study them in a random order. He shuffles the set through the program and studies them in a random order for better long-term retention.
